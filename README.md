#📘 Accessible Language Learning Platform

📌 Project Overview
The Accessible Language Learning Platform is a web‑based application designed to support learners with ADHD in learning English and Hindi.
The platform focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and personalization, ensuring that learners are not overwhelmed and can learn at their own pace.

The application is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and follows proper software engineering practices such as modular design and separation of concerns.

🎯 Objectives
To provide an accessible and distraction‑free learning environment

To support learners with ADHD through personalized guidance

To track learning progress in a positive, non‑stressful manner

To deliver gentle notifications and constructive feedback

To ensure scalability for future features

🧩 Functional Modules
The system is divided into the following functional modules:

Login Module
Provides secure and simple user authentication.

Personalized Guidance Module
Supports learners with adaptive and learner‑centric guidance.

Progress Tracking Module
Tracks learning progress in a simple and motivating way.

Notification Module
Sends gentle reminders and supportive notifications.

Feedback & Analysis Module
Provides constructive feedback to encourage continuous learning.
